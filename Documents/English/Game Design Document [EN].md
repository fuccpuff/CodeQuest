## Introduction
"CodeQuest: C#" is an innovative educational game aimed at teaching programming in the C# language. Combining elements of classic adventure games and engaging puzzles, it offers players a unique opportunity to learn while experiencing the joy and excitement of gameplay. The goal of the game is not only to teach the basics of C# programming but also to inspire players to deeply immerse themselves in the world of computer science.
The game is being developed with a wide range of players in mind - from absolute beginners to those who already have basic knowledge in programming. Special attention is given to creating an intuitive, user-friendly interface, as well as ensuring a smooth educational experience that is both informative and captivating.

## Game Overview
"CodeQuest: C#" is an adventure game with puzzle elements, designed to teach the C# programming language. The game is a combination of interactive tasks and an engaging storyline, where players explore various worlds, each dedicated to specific aspects of programming. The main goal is to help players master the basics of C# and develop problem-solving skills through coding.

The target audience includes:
- Beginners looking for an accessible way to learn C#.
- Students and schoolchildren interested in computer science.
- Puzzle and adventure game enthusiasts eager to try something new.

The game is intended for PC and Mac, with potential expansion to iOS and Android to reach a wider audience.

## Gameplay Mechanics
The core mechanic of the game revolves around writing real C# code to solve tasks and puzzles presented in the game. These tasks are integrated into the game world in such a way that learning goes hand in hand with the development of the story.

- Interaction with the game world: Players use code to manipulate objects in the game, solve puzzles, and overcome obstacles.
- Progression and learning: Tasks gradually become more complex, allowing players to develop their skills at a natural pace. Starting with simple concepts such as variables and operators, players gradually move on to more complex topics, including loops, arrays, and the basics of object-oriented programming.
- Interactive learning: In addition to traditional tasks, the game includes interactive lessons and practical tests that allow players to experiment with code in a safe and controlled environment.
- Feedback and assistance: The game provides immediate feedback on the code written, helping players understand their mistakes and improve their understanding of the material. An integrated hint system offers help when players encounter difficulties.

These mechanics ensure deep immersion in the learning process and offer players a unique experience that combines education and entertainment.

## Story and World
The player begins their journey in a virtual programming academy, where each level or section of the game represents different courses or classes. The main character is a young enthusiast aspiring to become an experienced programmer. Throughout the game, the player meets various characters: mentors, other students, and virtual assistants, each offering unique tasks and lessons.

The world of "CodeQuest: C#" is a visual metaphor of programming code and its elements. The game world consists of various "Islands of Knowledge," each representing different concepts of C#. For example, the "Variables Island" is dedicated to the basics of variables and data types, while the "Cyclical Labyrinth" introduces players to loops and iterations.
**Characters**
- Main character: The player's avatar, a budding programmer with big ambitions.
- Mentors: Virtual teachers who provide tasks, explain concepts, and offer solutions.
- Virtual assistants: Animated code symbols that interact with the player and help navigate the game world.

## Levels and Challenges
Each level in "CodeQuest: C#" represents a separate educational theme. Levels are designed so that each subsequent level builds on the knowledge gained in previous ones. Examples of levels include:
- Basics of C# (variables, data types, basic operators)
- Control Structures (conditional operators, loops)
- Collections and Arrays
- Basics of OOP (classes, objects, inheritance)
Players are presented with tasks at each level that require writing and debugging code. These tasks range from simple (e.g., creating and initializing variables) to complex (e.g., developing simple classes and methods). The tasks are presented in the form of game puzzles, where the correct solution allows the player to advance further.

## Interface and Control
**Interface**
- Main Menu: An intuitive menu with access to all main functions, including starting the game, settings, educational materials, and progress statistics.
- Game Interface: The screen displays control elements, a code inventory, current tasks, and a mini-map of the game world. All design elements are optimized for clarity and readability.
- Code Editor: An in-game code editor facilitates writing and testing code in real-time. It includes syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and debugging tools.
**Control**
- PC/Mac: Control using keyboard and mouse, where the keyboard is used for writing code and navigating menus, and the mouse for interacting with game world objects.
Mobile Devices: The touch screen is used for navigation and interaction with game elements. A virtual keyboard and simplified interface ensure ease of code entry.

## Graphics and Audio
**Graphic Design**
- Visual Style: Modern, minimalist graphics with bright, expressive colors. The design of characters and the game world is intended to be attractive and friendly.
- Animations: Smooth and expressive animations for characters and interactive objects that make the game world lively and dynamic.
**Audio Design**
- Music: The soundtrack combines motivating and soothing musical compositions that help maintain focus and interest in learning.
- Sound Effects: Quality sound effects for interface interaction, interacting with objects, and cues for task completion.

## Technologies
- Game Engine: Using Unity ensures a high degree of portability and easy transfer of the game to different platforms.
Programming Languages: Development is carried out in C# using modern programming practices.
- Compatibility: The game is optimized for a wide range of devices, including various PC and Mac configurations, as well as tablets and smartphones.
